I have a strong background in customer experience and project management. I recently graduated TripleTen's Data Analysis bootcamp! During my time I helped fellow students with assignments and projects. The TripleTen curriculum provides a wide range of projects based on the following technologies: Python, SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Data Analysis, Tableau, Git/Github, and much more.

I'd love to talk about how I can help your company better serve your customers!
