As a dedicated relationship builder with a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and project management, I am driven by the art of turning data into predictions and leveraging data-driven insights to empower informed decisions. I recently completed a 7-month data analytics boot camp at TripleTen and I am very excited to embark on this new career path.

🌟 Key Skills:
My skill set encompasses statistical data analysis and proficiency in tools like Python, SQL, Tableau and data visualization tools (seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly), and and various types of ML(supervised & unsupervised). Being a digital native, I bring a unique perspective, bridging the gap between traditional and emerging financial markets. I thrive on utilizing effective communication to build customer trust and loyalty.
