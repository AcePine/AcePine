[![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AcePine-grey?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&link=https://github.com/AcePine/)](https://www.github.com/AcePine/) [![Portfolio Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-web-blue?style=flat&link=https://github.com/AcePine/)](https://github.com/AcePine/) <p align='left'> I help companies use data to answer critical questions and better serve their customers!

I have a strong background in customer experience and project management. I recently graduated TripleTen's Data Analysis bootcamp! During my time I helped fellow students with assignments and projects. The TripleTen curriculum provides a wide range of projects based on the following technologies: Python, SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Data Analysis, Tableau, Git/Github, and much more.

I'd love to talk about how I can help your company better serve your customers!
