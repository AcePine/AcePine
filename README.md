[![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-AcePine-grey?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&link=https://github.com/AcePine/)](https://www.github.com/AcePine/) [![Portfolio Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/portfolio-web-blue?style=flat&link=https://github.com/AcePine/)](https://github.com/AcePine/) <p align='left'> I help companies use data to answer critical questions and better serve their customers!

As a dedicated relationship builder with a strong foundation in quantitative analysis and project management, I am driven by the art of turning data into predictions and leveraging data-driven insights to empower informed decisions. I recently completed a 7-month data analytics boot camp at TripleTen and I am very excited to embark on this new career path. My skills include data analytics, data visualization, Python, SQL, Tableau and various types of ML(supervised & unsupervised).

In my current role as a Senior Customer Experience Manager at 1st Day School Supplies, I've had the privilege of nurturing over 800 personal accounts, growing our book of business to a remarkable $3M+. Through creative digital advertising campaigns and excellent customer care, I've contributed to a 500% increase in sales. Salesforce has been my trusted ally in crafting custom reports and employing advanced prospecting techniques, even in the most competitive landscapes.

Prior to this, as a Customer Success Manager at TradeOff Technologies, I shaped a customer journey that delivered advanced financial literacy to over 100,000 professional traders and investors. My role expanded to Affiliate Manager, overseeing marketing partners, influencers, and more. My knack for project management led global teams across four continents to deliver exceptional results and meet deadlines with precision.

In my capacity as Director of Trading at Top Trade Tools, I honed my expertise in financial markets and trading instruments, helping clients worldwide gain insights into the dynamic world of trading. I spearheaded market analysis and led a customer engagement team that effectively communicated complex algorithmic trading tools and strategies to clients. My efforts streamlined processes and created a standardized approach for customer engagement.

üåü Key Skills:
My skill set encompasses building customer trust and loyalty, effective communication, statistical data analysis, and proficiency in tools like Python, SQL, Tableau and data visualization tools (seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly). Being a digital native, I bring a unique perspective, bridging the gap between traditional and emerging financial markets.

üåê Let's Connect:
I'm passionate about connecting with like-minded professionals who value innovation, data-driven decision-making, and the evolving world of finance and technology. Let's connect!
